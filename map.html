  <h1>How to Install Maps in Minecraft PE</h1>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Make sure you have downloaded and installed Minecraft PE on your device. You can download it from the app store that is compatible with your device's operating system.</li>
    <li>Find the map you want to install. You can search for it on websites or Minecraft forums that provide maps for Minecraft PE. Ensure that the map you choose is compatible with the version of Minecraft PE you have.</li>
    <li>Once you have found the desired map, download the map file to your device. The map file will have the .mcworld extension.</li>
    <li>After the download is complete, locate the map file on your device. Usually, the map file will be in the "Downloads" folder.</li>
    <li>Double-tap on the map file. This will open Minecraft PE and import the map into the game.</li>
    <li>After the map is imported, you will see a confirmation message in Minecraft PE. Follow the instructions that appear on the screen to enable the map.</li>
    <li>Once the map is enabled, you can start a new game or continue an existing game with the map installed.</li>
    <li>To use the map, open the game menu in Minecraft PE and select "Play" or "Play New" to create a new game. Choose "Create New World" or "Edit" on an existing game.</li>
    <li>In the game settings screen, look for the "Resource Packs" or "Behavior Packs" option. Here, you will find the installed map. Activate the map by clicking the checkbox next to it.</li>
    <li>After configuring the game settings according to your preference, press "Play" or "Create World" to start the game with the installed map.</li>
  </ol>
